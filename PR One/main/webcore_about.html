As it was in Babylonia, so too is the quality of beer in Germany legislatively regulated by the authorities - and beer is still an important source of tax revenue. The first regulation appeared in Augsburg. Establishments that served bad beer or dishonest amounts would fined and their beer destroyed.For many centuries, beer has been a regular and continuous part of the everyday diet in all levels of society.

            <p class="historical_points_text">The best known and most famous brewing law is the Reinheitsgebot. The "Purity Law" is the oldest food regulation in the world and still exists today unchanged from the original. It was ordered by Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria in the year 1516. See picture above. It said that beer should only be brewed from barley, hops and water. Thanks to the regulation, Bavarian beers then became leaders among their peers. Thus other lands of Germany also enforced the regulation.The best known and most famous brewing law is the Reinheitsgebot.
